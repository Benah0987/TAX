#Project Title: Net Salary Calculator

#Project Description
This is a web-based net salary calculator that computes an individual's net salary after deducting all taxes, pensions, and other applicable expenses. The calculator takes in the gross salary, pension contribution, NHIF deduction, affordable housing relief, owner-occupier interest, and disability exemption. It also retrieves the Personal Relief, Insurance Relief, Allowable Pension Contribution, and Allowable Hosp Contribution parameters to calculate the monthly taxable pay and Pay As You Earn (PAYE).

#How it works
The calculator has input fields and dropdown menus where the user enters values for pension contribution, NHIF deduction, affordable housing relief, owner-occupier interest, and disability exemption. The calculator then retrieves other parameters such as Personal Relief, Insurance Relief, Allowable Pension Contribution, and Allowable Hosp Contribution to calculate the monthly taxable pay and PAYE. It then uses the monthly taxable pay to calculate the gross salary and then deducts all taxes, pensions, and other applicable expenses to compute the net salary.
